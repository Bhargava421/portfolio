            Hello! I'm Bhargava C Salian, a passionate student and aspiring web developer based in Karkala.
            I love creating engaging, responsive, and user-friendly web experiences that combine creativity with functionality. As a student, I'm constantly learning and exploring the ever-evolving world of web development, driven by curiosity and a desire to build impactful digital solutions.

            I'm skilled in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and currently diving deeper into frameworks like React and styling tools like Tailwind CSS. I enjoy bringing ideas to life through clean, efficient code and intuitive design.

            Outside of coding, Iâ€™m always exploring new technologies, working on personal projects, and improving my problem-solving skills. I believe in continuous growth and am excited about contributing to real-world projects and collaborating with like-minded developers.
